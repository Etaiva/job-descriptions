Do project managers get training in SQL or do they do a sort of learn on the job type basis? 
If they don't have previous SQL or database background is it more desirable for employers when someone does have that knowledge?

Good Answer
There are project managers that just manage projects (Money, Time and Resources), they need only project management skills.
But if you are involved in any project that contain databases I'd say it wouldn't be bad to know some SQL. 
Because that tells that you understand how databases work.

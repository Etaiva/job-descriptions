Data scientist needs to have excellent knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics. 
The person should be fluent with numbers and have sharp memory while playing around with them. 
Should posses quick calculative skills. He should have ready to solve a problem attitude. 
Now in order to get a job one needs excellent coding skills for data analysis such as R or Python and have good excel capabilities as well. 
The person should learn Machine learning modelling and solve challenges including Regression and Classification datasets. 
Kaggle is the best platform for such learning.

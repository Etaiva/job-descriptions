Experience & Background *
How many years of experience do you have in corporate governance, and can you highlight key projects or assignments you have completed (e.g., board assessments, governance frameworks, advisory work)?

Caveat to your question of Rate: Key Factors Affecting the Rate
Experience Level: An expert with 15+ years of experience (as requested in the job description) would command a significantly higher rate than a mid-level professional.

Project Scope: The complexity of the work is a primary driver. A standard governance framework review will be priced differently than a full-scale forensic investigation or a complex board assessment.

Client: Larger, multi-national corporations typically have higher budgets and are prepared to pay a premium for specialized expertise.

Value Delivered: The rate often reflects the potential impact of the project. If a consultant helps a company avoid a major scandal or secure a critical deal, their value is much higher than the time they spend on the project.

Market: Rates can fluctuate based on supply and demand for a particular skill set. Given the high demand for AI and legal governance, a consultant with your background may be able to charge a premium rate.

I have over 8 years of experience in corporate governance, risk, and compliance, with a focus on both advisory and forensic work (20 years if you look at it from a HR Strategy perspective). A key highlight was a forensic review I was involved in, that exposed significant oversight breakdowns, which ultimately helped a client implement stronger governance mechanisms and avoid a major public scandal. In another assignment, I successfully identified and resolved critical internal control weaknesses, which prevented potential fraud losses for the business. I have extensive experience in developing risk-based policies and integrated compliance frameworks, ensuring clients are audit-ready and secure.
Qualifications *
What is your highest relevant qualification, and do you hold any governance-related certifications or memberships (e.g., CGISA, CSSA, LLB, ICSA)?

My highest relevant qualification is a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from the University of South Africa. I also hold a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Henley Business School, which gives me a strong foundation in strategic business operations.
Board Assessments *
Have you conducted or supported board assessments, and can you briefly share your role in the process?

I have hands-on experience in supporting and leading board assessments. I recently led a project where I conducted a deep-dive internal control assessment and an oversight audit as part of a comprehensive governance review. My role was to provide subject matter expertise, deliver actionable insights, and produce high-quality reports that communicated the findings and recommendations to the board and senior management.

Report Writing *
Do you have experience producing high-quality governance reports for executive or board-level stakeholders?

I have extensive experience producing high-quality governance reports for executive and board-level stakeholders. A core part of my role is translating complex findings from forensic reviews and audits into clear, structured, and professional reports that provide actionable recommendations. My reports are designed to be concise and impactful, helping senior leaders make informed decisions.

Availability *
How soon can you start on a full-time basis?

I am available to start from September 10, 2025.

Location *
Where are you based?

I usually work remotely, however I am available in Gauteng and in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
